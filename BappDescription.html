<p>This extension renders responses returned in the Repeater tool in a real browser (specifically Firefox).
</p>
<p>The extension uses Selenium, a popular browser automation framework, to control the web browser when the Repeater tool is used in Burp Suite.
Think of this extension as the automatic 'Show Response In Browser' (SRIB) tool.
Instead of using the SRIB feature repeatedly in Burp Suite, this extension automates the process and makes pen-testing web apps that use mostly JavaScript rendered web pages much easier.</p>
<p><b>Known Issue:</b> If a JavaScript alert box appears and the operator manually accepts the alert, Selenium will cease operation and the extension will deadlock.
The only work around for this issue is to manually close the browser and restart the 
extension.</p>
